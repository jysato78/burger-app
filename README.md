# burger-app

This app acts as a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and ORM. Node and MySQL were used to query and route data and Handlebars were used to generate the HTML.  As the final step, the app was deployed on Heroku:

If the user clicks on the Eat Me button, that particular burger gets moved to the right side of the screen.  The user can add a new burger by typing in a name and clicking the Add button.  The new burger gets displayed on the left side of the screen.
